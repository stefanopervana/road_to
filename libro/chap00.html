<p>I love to teach, even though I am no expert. I learn every day and I have the fortune to have great mentors. After all not everyone has the opportunity to learn from mentors and peers. The book is my attempt to give something back. It might help people to get started and advance in React.</p>

<p><strong>But why me?</strong> In the past I have written a large tutorial to implement a <a href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/the-soundcloud-client-in-react-redux">SoundCloud Client in React + Redux</a>. I never expected the overwhelming reaction. I learned a lot during the process of writing. But even more by getting your feedback. It was my first attempt to teach people in programming.</p>

<p>It also taught me to do better. I realized the SoundCloud tutorial is suited for advanced developers. It uses several tools to bootstrap your application and dives quickly into Redux. Still it helped a lot of people to get started. In my opinion it is a great tutorial to get a bigger picture of React + Redux. I use every free minute to improve the material, but it is time consuming.</p>

<p>In the Road to learn React I want to offer a foundation before you start to dive into the broader React ecosystem. It has less tooling and less external state management, but a lot of information around React. It explains general concepts, patterns and best practices.</p>

<p>You will learn to build your own Hacker News application. It covers real world features like pagination, client-side caching and interactions like searching and sorting. Additionally you will transition from JavaScript ES5 to JavaScript ES6 on the way. In conclusion, the book should give you a solid foundation in React before you dive into more advanced topics like Redux. I hope this book captures my enthusiasm for React and JavaScript and helps you to get started.</p>
