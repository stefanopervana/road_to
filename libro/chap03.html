<p><strong>How do I get updates?</strong> You can <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/rwieruch">subscribe</a> to my Newsletter or follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/rwieruch">Twitter</a> to get updates. It keeps me motivated to continue. Once you have a copy of the book, it will stay updated. But you have to download the copy again when an update is announced. I will notify everyone by a <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/rwieruch">Newsletter</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/rwieruch">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Does it use the recent React version?</strong> Books are outdated pretty soon after their release. Since this book is self-published, I can update it whenever I want. In conclusion, I update the resource whenever there is a new React version.</p>

<p><strong>Does it cover Redux?</strong> It doesn’t. The book should give you a solid foundation before you dive into advanced topics. Still the implementation in the book will show you that you don’t need Redux to build an application. After you have read the book, you should be able to implement a solid application without Redux. You can pre-order my next book to support me: <a href="https://gumroad.com/products/uwiyI">The Road to learn Redux</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Does it use JavaScript ES6?</strong> Yes. But don’t worry. You will be fine if you are familiar with JavaScript ES5. All JavaScript ES6 features I describe on the journey to learn React will transition from ES5 to ES6 in the book. Every feature along the way will be explained. The book does not only teach React, but also all useful JavaScript ES6 features for React.</p>

<p><strong>Will you add more chapters in the future?</strong> You can have a look at the Change Log chapter for major updates that already happened. There will be unannounced improvements in between all the time. In general it depends on the community whether I continue to work on the book. If there is an acceptance for the book, I will deliver more chapters and improve the old material. I will keep the content up to date with recent best practices, concepts and patterns. I would love to hear your thoughts about possible chapters to improve and enrich the learning experience.</p>

<p><strong>What are the reading formats?</strong> In addition to the .pdf, .epub, and .mobi formats, you can read it in pure markdown on <a href="https://github.com/rwieruch/the-road-to-learn-react">GitHub</a>. In general, I recommend reading it on a suitable format, otherwise the code snippets will have ugly line breaks.</p>

<p><strong>Why is the book pay what you want?</strong> I have put a lot of effort into this and will do so in the future. My desire is to reach as many people as possible. Everyone should be enabled to learn React. Still you could pay - if you can afford it - because it already took me a lot of my time to write and improve the book.</p>

<p><strong>Can I help to improve it?</strong> Yes. You can have a direct impact with your thoughts and <a href="https://github.com/rwieruch/the-road-to-learn-react">contributions on GitHub</a>. I don’t claim to be an expert nor to write in native English. I would appreciate your help very much.</p>

<p><strong>Can I support the project?</strong> Yes. Feel free to reach out or to support me. I invest a lot of my time into open source tutorials and learning resources. You can have a look at my <a href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/about/">about me</a> page.</p>
